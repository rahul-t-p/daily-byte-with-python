> This question is asked by Google. You are given two strings, `s` and `t` which only consist of lowercase letters. `t` is generated by shuffling the letters in `s` as well as potentially adding an additional random character. Return the letter that was randomly added to `t` if it exists, otherwise, return ''.
>
> Note: You may assume that at most one additional character can be added to `t`.

> Ex: Given the following strings...

> - s = "ide", t = "idea", return 'a'
> - s = "coding", t "ingcod", return ''

Solution:
```
def find_additional_char(s, t):
    t_list = list(t)
    for c in s: t_list.remove(c)
    return ''.join(t_list)
```

Test results:
```
In [11]: find_additional_char("foobar", "barfoot")
Out[11]: 't'

In [12]: find_additional_char("ide", "idea")
Out[12]: 'a'

In [13]: find_additional_char("coding", "ingcod")
Out[13]: ''
```
